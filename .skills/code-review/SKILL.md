# Code Review Skill

Review code thoroughly before making any changes. For every issue or recommendation, explain the concrete tradeoffs, give an opinionated recommendation, and ask for user input before assuming a direction.

## Engineering Preferences

Use these to guide all recommendations:

- **DRY is important** — flag repetition aggressively.
- **Well-tested code is non-negotiable** — rather have too many tests than too few.
- **"Engineered enough"** — not under-engineered (fragile, hacky) and not over-engineered (premature abstraction, unnecessary complexity).
- **Handle more edge cases, not fewer** — thoughtfulness > speed.
- **Bias toward explicit over clever.**

## Review Sections

### 1. Architecture Review

Evaluate:

- Overall system design and component boundaries.
- Dependency graph and coupling concerns.
- Data flow patterns and potential bottlenecks.
- Scaling characteristics and single points of failure.
- Security architecture (auth, data access, API boundaries).

### 2. Code Quality Review

Evaluate:

- Code organization and module structure.
- DRY violations — be aggressive here.
- SOLID violations - aggressive here too.
- Error handling patterns and missing edge cases (call these out explicitly).
- Technical debt hotspots.
- Areas that are over-engineered or under-engineered relative to the engineering preferences above.

### 3. Performance Review

Evaluate:

- N+1 queries and database access patterns.
- Memory-usage concerns.
- Caching opportunities.
- Slow or high-complexity code paths.

## For Each Issue Found

For every specific issue (bug, smell, design concern, or risk):

1. **Describe the problem concretely**, with file and line references.
2. **Present 2-3 options**, including "do nothing" where that's reasonable.
3. For each option, specify: **implementation effort, risk, impact on other code, and maintenance burden**.
4. **Give a recommended option and why**, mapped to the engineering preferences above.
5. Then **explicitly ask whether the user agrees or wants a different direction** before proceeding.

## Workflow and Interaction

- Do not assume priorities on timeline or scale.
- After each section, pause and ask for feedback before moving on.

## Before Starting

Ask if the user wants one of two modes:

1. **BIG CHANGE:** Work through interactively, one section at a time (Architecture -> Code Quality -> Performance) with **at most 4 top issues** in each section.
2. **SMALL CHANGE:** Work through interactively, **ONE question per review section**.

## Output Format Rules

For each stage of review:

- Output the explanation and pros/cons of each issue along with an opinionated recommendation and why.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` at the end of each section.
- **NUMBER issues** (1, 2, 3, 4) and give **LETTERS for options** (A, B, C).
- When using `AskUserQuestion`, each option must clearly label the **issue NUMBER and option LETTER** so the user doesn't get confused.
- **The recommended option is always the 1st option.**
