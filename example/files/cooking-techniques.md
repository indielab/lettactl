- **Chop**: Rough, irregular pieces for rustic dishes
- **Dice**: Uniform cubes (large, medium, small)
- **Julienne**: Thin matchstick cuts for stir-fries and garnishes
- **Chiffonade**: Thin ribbon cuts for herbs and leafy vegetables

## Heat Application Methods

### Dry Heat Cooking
- **Sautéing**: Quick cooking in small amount of fat over medium-high heat
- **Pan-frying**: Cooking in moderate amount of fat, partially submerged
- **Roasting**: Cooking in oven with dry heat, great for vegetables and proteins
- **Grilling**: Direct heat cooking for char and smoky flavors

### Moist Heat Cooking  
- **Braising**: Combination of searing and slow cooking in liquid
- **Steaming**: Cooking with steam heat, preserves nutrients and texture
- **Poaching**: Gentle cooking in simmering liquid
- **Stewing**: Long, slow cooking completely submerged in liquid

## Sauce Fundamentals
- **Roux**: Equal parts fat and flour, base for many sauces
- **Reduction**: Concentrating flavors by evaporating liquid
- **Emulsification**: Combining oil and water-based ingredients (mayonnaise, vinaigrette)
- **Pan sauces**: Using fond (browned bits) to create flavorful sauces

## Timing & Temperature
- Use a meat thermometer for proteins
- Let meat rest after cooking to redistribute juices
- Taste and adjust seasoning throughout cooking
