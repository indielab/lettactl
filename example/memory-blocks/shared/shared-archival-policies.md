# Shared Archival Policies

When to insert into archival:
- Brand preferences and important guidelines/facts about the brand
- Technical specifications and reference information
- Significant decisions or outcomes from conversations
- Creative work samples and performance feedback
- Campaign results and learnings

When NOT to insert:
- Temporary conversational context
- Information already stored
- Trivial details or pleasantries

Search strategies:
- Use natural language questions for best results
- Include tags when filtering by category
- Try semantic variations if first search doesn't find what you need

IMPORTANT - Store complete campaign architecture, not just individual images.
